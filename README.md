# AWS SDK PLAY
Experimenting with the AWS SDK.

## TUTORIALS
- [Writing Javascript Applications with the AWS SDK: AWS RE:INVENT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpaEA6FM8K0)
- [Creating and Using S3 Buckets in Node.js](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/s3-example-creating-buckets.html)

## NOTES
- Set IAM roles for groups and enable PERMISSIONS, otherwise you'll always get the 'accessDenied' response from AWS.
- use 'chalk.red('\<string\>)' to see the unix console color string for colors.
